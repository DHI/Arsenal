We need to (dramatically) improve on "guestimating" work loads and team velocity will help with that.
We dont have any velocity data... so how do we start (obviously a typical scenario when new teams are first assembled).

How to go about remedying this: simply start by estimating **every story** pulled onto the sprint backlog - even if they are wildly
inaccurate. This will provide a sum of points for the sprint.

Its hard to estimate (accurately). To assist in this process:
- `estimate in relative terms`. Dont say "this will take 8 hours", rather say "this will take 2 times longer than that other story.
- `throw backlog items into buckets`. Buckets are labeled by story point size. A typical set of "buckets" may be labelled based on
a fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Next select a story, divide that into tasks and estimate the number of hours needed to commit to completing that task. Repeat until
sprint has been fully allocated. Whether or not the team completes said tasks is impossible to determine because at this stage the
team as no velocity data to measure against. But.... because story points were allocated, at the start of the sprint we at least have an initial 
velocity. By the end of the first sprint though, regardless of how many tasks were completed (ie done done) or not completed, we will have a more accurate guestimate 
for the team's velocity. From this point on, as each sprint is completed, the velocity of the team only improves. This will in turn
provide for a continuing basis upon which accurate estimates can be made or at the least, an increasing level of confidence in the team in meeting feature delivery
milestones.
