# Shared Web Dev

This project contains resources intended for sharing across DHI projects and for comparison.

## TSDXRWS

> TSDX https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx
> RWS react-with-storybook template

This is for comparison.

## React

A project which tries to marry webpack+react+ts to output react components as simple as can be.

By choosing this tooling we are keeping our mindshare.

- React components and accompanying MST models
- Tooling, storybook, webpack etc.
- Exports components in one package `@dhi/webdev`
