## Eslint / Prettier

> Name: ESLint    
> Id: dbaeumer.vscode-eslint    
> Description: Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code.    
> Version: 2.1.5    
> Publisher: Dirk Baeumer    
> VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.    vscode-eslint

This, combined with the eslint configurations in one of the projects in this repo will give you an excellent auto-formatting workflow.

You shouldn't need to manually run lint commands on the CLI except for in automated pipelines and during large reviews/merges/refactors.

## Diagrams

> Name: Draw.io Integration    
> Id: hediet.vscode-drawio    
> Description: This unofficial extension integrates Draw.io into VS Code.    
> Version: 0.7.2    
> Publisher: Henning Dieterichs    
> VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.    vscode-drawio

This extension enables a very cool workflow.

It allows us to create a file named `myDiagram.drawio.png` and embed that into our markdown files. 

This means we can create quick visual diagrams to enrich our documentation and keep it all synced nicely within our git repo!

## PDF's

> Name: vscode-pdf    
> Id: tomoki1207.pdf    
> Description: Display pdf file in VSCode.    
> Version: 1.0.0    
> Publisher: tomoki1207    
> VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf    

This is another useful tool to ensure we keep our documentation in our repo.

Just throw any relevant documents into ./docs for future you or a coworker.

## Code Tour

> Name: CodeTour    
> Id: vsls-contrib.codetour    
> Description: VS Code extension that allows you to record and playback guided tours of    
> codebases, directly within the editor    
> Version: 0.0.34    
> Publisher: Live Share Contrib    
> VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.    codetour

Very useful for providing a way to walk through your codebase. This enables an interesting workflow for introductions to new projects, or explaining implementations of distinct features.
