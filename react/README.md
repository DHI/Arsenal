# @dhi/webdev

Intended to eventually publish `@dhi/webdev`.

Currently the project only includes react components, but it would be ideal if it could include anything webdev related.

## Usage

Build then check the exports:
```
yarn build && yarn ts-node test/testBuiltComponentExports.ts

```

The project build to `build` then we `cd build && npm publish` to publish.
